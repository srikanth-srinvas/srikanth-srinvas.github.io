---**About me**


I'm currently a postgraduate [MSc Bioinformatics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/studypostgraduate/taught/msc-bioinformatics/) student at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/). I first became interested in bioinformatics during my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology. A course on bioinformatics sparked my passion for using data analysis to study biological questions. Inspired by this quote, "Our world is built on biology and once we begin to understand it, it then becomes a technology," by Ryan Bethencourt, I became fascinated to harness the combined potential of biology and data science to address pressing research questions in the modern world.

I've gained hands-on bioinformatics experience by interning at a [NIHR Global Health Research Unit](https://ghru.pathogensurveillance.net/) partner lab [Central Research Laboratory, KIMS](https://www.crlkims.com/), focusing on genomic surveillance of AMR in India. Initially during this internship, I gained valuable bioinformatics skills, which I then applied to contribute to several impactful projects.

I have contributed to data-driven microbial informatics and genomic surveillance projects by analyzing genomic data of thousands of [WHO-priority pathogens](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed). I've had the opportunity to communicate my research to wider audience through presentations at several international conferences.


Beyond the lab, I love going on hikes and playing sports, and also Iâ€™m a passionate tech enthusiast with a constant love for exploring new gadgets and innovations in the tech industry.

Thanks for stopping by!
