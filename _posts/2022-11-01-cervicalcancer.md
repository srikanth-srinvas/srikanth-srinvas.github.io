#### This project was a part of my undergraduate thesis at [Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering](https://www.dsce.edu.in/research/123-biotechnology) with my wonderful coursemates and co-authors Akanksha Hegde and Viola Monteiro under the guidance of my professor [Dr. Shashank Tidke](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=d57csx0AAAAJ&hl=en)
*Annona muricata*, commonly known as soursop or graviola, is a tropical plant with potential health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer and anti-microbial potential of the plant extract using both in-silico and in-vitro approaches.

## Introduction

- *Annona muricata* (soursop) is a tropical plant with potential health benefits.
Conventional cancer treatments can have severe side effects.
- Nanotechnology offers promising solutions for drug delivery and treatments.
- Plant extracts have been explored as alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to the rise of antibiotic resistance.
## Objectives

- Identify potential lead molecules in Annona muricata through an *in-silico* approach (computer simulations).
- Evaluate the anti-cancer and anti-microbial potential of the plant extract using *in-vitro* methods (laboratory experiments).
## Methodology

### *In-silico* Approach:
Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction of plant compounds with potential anti-cancer and anti-microbial targets.
### In-vitro Approach:
- The methanolic extract of *Annona muricata* leaves was prepared using the Soxhlet extraction method.
- The total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extract was estimated .
Phytochemical profiling was performed using GC-MS to identify the bioactive compounds present.
- The cytotoxic activity of the extract against a cancer cell line (KB cells) was assessed using the MTT assay.
- Green synthesis of MgO nanoparticles (Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticles) was achieved using the Annona muricata leaf extract.
- The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy.
- The anti-bacterial potential of the MgO nanoparticles was investigated against various bacterial strains.
## Results and Discussion

- The *in-silico studies* identified potential lead molecules in the plant extract with promising anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties.
- The *in-vitro* studies confirmed the presence of bioactive compounds in the extract, including phenolics and flavonoids.
- The extract exhibited cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.
- The green-synthesized MgO nanoparticles showed potential anti-bacterial activity.
## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of *Annona muricata* as a source of natural bioactive compounds with anti-cancer and anti-microbial properties. Green synthesis of MgO nanoparticles using the plant extract offers a promising approach for developing novel antibacterial agents.

## My role in this project
 I played a pivotal role in the bioinformatics analysis of this project. I employed tools such as [Autodock Vina](https://vina.scripps.edu/) and iGEMdock to conduct molecular docking simulations, predicting the interactions between the identified lead compounds from *Annona muricata* and potential target proteins. Additionally, I utilized [Biovia Discovery Studio](https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia/discovery-studio) for visual analysis, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the binding interactions and conformational changes induced by these compounds and I also performed ADMET analysis of the potential lead molecule structures using the [Swiss-ADME tool](http://www.swissadme.ch/).
