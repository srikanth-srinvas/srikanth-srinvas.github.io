## Introduction
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a significant pathogen causing infections in pregnant women and newborns. Despite the widespread use of β-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) for treatment, increasing antibiotic resistance poses a serious public health threat. This study aimed to investigate the role of mutations in the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) genes in conferring β-lactam resistance in GBS isolates from India.

## Methods
This study utilized 128 GBS isolates collected from multiple centers across India. The isolates were identified and tested for Antibiotic Sensitivity using the VITEK 2 Compact system, followed by whole genome sequencing on the Illumina platform. PBP typing was done using a Nextflow pipeline by the [Bentley group at The Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://github.com/sanger-bentley-group/GBS-Typer-sanger-nf) and the pbp alleles were characterized using the GATK tool to identify the mutations. Statistical analysis was performed to determine associations between mutations, resistance, and clonal complexes.
## Results
Our analysis revealed a significant association between a specific mutation in the pbp2x gene, Q557E, and elevated resistance to BLAs, including penicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. This mutation corresponds to a previously described resistance-conferring mutation in pneumococci. Additionally, we observed a high prevalence of the pbp2B allele, followed by pbp1A and pbp2x. Interestingly, one isolate lacking the pbp2x allele exhibited high levels of β-lactam resistance, suggesting the involvement of other factors in resistance.

## Conclusion

Mutations in PBP genes, particularly the Q557E mutation in pbp2x, play a crucial role in conferring β-lactam resistance in GBS isolates from India. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these mutations is essential for developing effective strategies to combat GBS infections and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance.
